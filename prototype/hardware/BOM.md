# BILL Of Materials - High level outline

## Solar Panel
The solar panel is responsible for locally generating the energy to charge the batteries inside the ColaLight, we are aiming to make this item rugged and efficient
### Photovoltaic panel (3-5Watt)
This is the energy generating part of the equation, this provides electrons out for photon in! We need to choose an efficient but economical panel in the range of 3-5 Watts
### Protective corners for panel - printed
The panels are fairly easy to chip and break we will need to protect the corners and provide mounting for the electronics. Ideally we can 3D print these parts using recycled bottle plastic (Molding is also a possibility for manufacture)
### Printed circuit board for MPPT
Each panel will also house a Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) printed circuit board which makes charging of the USB connector/cable efficient as connecting directly to the panel throws away much of the generated energy.
### Electronics for MPPT
The MPPT will comprise of a small low cost micro-controller, a buck step down section as well as reverse protection diodes and other safety elements.

## Light
The light is responsible for storing the energy and lighting, the design is centered around a recycled Cola bottle
### Recycled bottle
Cola bottles are recycled, processed and cleaned for our use
### Cap - printed
The Cap is a 3D printed (May be molded for manufacturing) from recycled cola bottle materials. It has a screw thread for attaching to the holder insert. It also has apertures for the USB Charge socket and a small switch to control the light
### Holder insert - printed
The holder insert has a threaded top to allow the cap to be attached. It also is responsible for holding the electronics, batteries and LED. This will be 3D printed from recycled cola bottles (Could also be molded in manufacture from same materials).
### Batteries - 2 x AA
The batteries are responsible for storing the ColaLight SLK energy, this in turn is used to light the LED and or charge a phone. Although we haven't yet decided on the batteries, Li-ion and Ni-MH are the current front runners. If we go the Li-Ion route the physical dimensions of the battery may not be 'AA' but perhaps something more convenient to fit the bottle/holder
### Printed circuit board
The printed circuit board houses the electronics which controls charging, discharging and lighting of the ColaLight SLK.

## Accessories
### USB Cable
A USB cable is required for charging the device or connecting to a phone to charge it, we may need an adaptor for this second function.
### Colalight Branding sticker inc QRcode
Each ColaLight needs a QR identifier that can be photographed and registered, it is also an opportunity to brand the ColaLight SLK
### Instructions, quick start diagram
The quick start guide should be a graphical (to get over language barriers) illustration of the products operation and use. This can be accompanied by a more detailed multi lingual instructions fold out
