## Solar Panel
The solar panel is responsible for locally generating the energy to charge the batteries inside the ColaLight, we are aiming to make this item rugged and efficient
### Photovoltaic panel (3-5Watt)
This is the energy generating part of the equation, this provides electrons out for photon in! we need to choose an efficient but economical panel in the range of 3-5 Watts
### Protective corners for panel - printed
The panels are fairly easy to chip and break we will need to protect the cornersand provide mounting for the electronics. Ideaally we can 3d print these parts using recycled bottle plastic (Molding is also a possibility for manufacture)
### Printed circuit board for MPPT
Each panel will also house a Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) printed cicuit board which makes charging of the USB connector/cable efficient as connecting directly to the panel throws away much of teh genrated energy.
### Electronics for MPPT
The MPPT will comprose of a smalllow cost micro-controller, a buck step down section as well as reverse protection diodes and other safety elements.
