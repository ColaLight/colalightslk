# Prototype design review - 7th March 2014

## Electronics

### Mezzanine
#### Circular routing needs to be wider 2mm rather than 1mm to allow cutting
#### Circular routing needs a greater radius in order to clear neck thread
#### Pentagon radius needs reduces a little (or rounding perhaps) to allow simpler insertion
#### We need to solve the double sided pasting and reflow issues
#### Mezzanine umbilical should be directly solder
#### Consider dual purpose controller/up lighter PCB to solve double sided issues

## Mechanical
#### Reflective silver card inserts work well but we should source material with high reflectivity
#### Cutting the reflectors is difficult using compass and scissors, we need to find a better way (or manufacturer)
#### Diffusion results are good but I wonder what luminance we may be dropping, this needs quantifying and exploring further
#### We need to add a battery compartment/adaptor
#### We need to integrate USB openings
#### Water proofing with USB may be a real problem, explore solutions
#### It's rather fiddly assembling the various parts, lets focus on making this simpler
#### We will need to punch of drill the screw cap to allow the mezzanine umbilical passage

## Aux operations required
#### Button control for lighting modes, iterates through 4 settings off on low, low up , low down, full
#### Posible MPPT integration
#### Current integrating and monitoring
#### Output charger (USB phone socket)
