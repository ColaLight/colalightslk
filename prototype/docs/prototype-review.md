# Prototype design review - 7th March 2014

## Electronics

### Mezannine
#### Circular routing needs to be wider 2mm rather than 1m to allow cutting
#### Circular routing needs a greate radius in order to clear neck thread
#### Pentagon radius needs reduces a little (or rounding perhaps) to allow simpler insertion
#### We need to solve the double sided pasting and reflow issues
#### Mezzanine umbilicle should be directly solder
#### Consider dual purpose controller/uplighter PCB to sovle double sided issues

## Mechanical
### Reflective silver card inserts work well but we should source material with high reflectivity
### Cutting the reflectors is difficult using compass and scissors, we need to find a better way (or manufacturer)
### Diffusion results are good but I windor what luminace we may be dropping, this needs quantifying and exploring further
### We need to add a battery compartment/adaptor
### We need to integrate usb openings
### Water rpoofing with USB may be a real problem, explore solutions
### It's rather fiddly assembling the various parts, lets focus on making this simpler
### We will need to punch of drill the screw cap to allow the mezzanine umbilical passage
